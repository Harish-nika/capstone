a)     ACAD - ACADEMICS
b)     PAT - PLACEMENT AND TRAINING
Students who have already received Internship offer through CDC have to register the course under “PAT - PLACEMENT AND TRAINING”. The remaining students have to register under ACAD – Academics, for which a “Faculty Guide” is to be selected. (Guide change option will be enabled during Add / Drop period)
Students can change the option from ACAD to PAT whenever an internship offer is received in future by submitting a proof (received from CDC) and a consent letter (from the Guide) to Academics Office.
